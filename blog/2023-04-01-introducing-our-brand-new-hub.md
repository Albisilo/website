## ✨ Hello World

We are excited to announce the launch of our brand new website and documentation hub for the Telegram Bot SDK for PHP. With this launch, we have made significant upgrades and improvements to the website, making it easier than ever for developers to create engaging and interactive Telegram chatbots for their clients or projects using our SDK.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Telegram Bot SDK for PHP, it is the ultimate toolkit for building Telegram chatbots with Laravel support out of the box. With the rise of chatbots as a popular way of communicating with users, this SDK has become an essential tool for chatbot developers who want to create Telegram bots for their clients or projects.

Our new website is designed to be an easy-to-use resource for developers of all levels. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, you will find valuable resources and information on our site. We have streamlined the documentation and made it more accessible, with improved navigation, multilingual support, and search features to help you find what you need quickly and easily.

Here are some highlights of this brand new hub!

## 📚 All SDK Versions' Documentations and Changelogs

One of the most significant features of our new website is that we have made all versions of the SDK documentation available in one place. This includes all the changelogs, so you can quickly see what has changed and keep a track. This feature ensures that you always have the most up-to-date information and can quickly reference past releases.

## 🌗 Dark and Light Mode

We know how important it is to have a website that is easy on the eyes, and that's why we have included both dark and light modes on our website. This feature lets you switch between the two modes easily, ensuring that you can work comfortably, no matter what time of day or night it is.

## 📝 Blog

To keep you updated with the latest news and developments, we have included a blog on our website where we will post all the latest news and major release announcements. This feature will keep you informed and engaged with the latest releases of our SDK.

## 🕶️ Awesome Resources

We have also included a curated list of [awesome resources](/community/resources) built with or for Telegram Bot SDK, open-source projects, guides, blogs, and other resources on our website. This list includes links to tools, libraries, and other resources that can help you in your development journey.

## 🔍 Easy Documentation Search

To make it easier for you to find what you need, we have incorporated Algolia search into our documentation. This feature lets you search our documentation quickly and easily, ensuring that you can find what you need in a matter of seconds.

## 📒 Guides

Our website now includes guides to help you get started with Telegram Bot development using our SDK. These guides cover everything from basic concepts to more advanced techniques, ensuring that you have all the information you need to get started with Telegram Bot SDK.

## 👥 Community Section

We have also included a community section on our website, which provides an overview of our team, a guide to contributing, release process, and support info. This will help you get involved in our community and make the most out of the SDK.

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

Finally, we are proud to announce that our new website includes support for translations, making it easier for developers around the world to access our resources and documentation. We understand the importance of having access to information in one's native language, and that is why we are inviting developers to contribute to the translation of our site.
